# Contributing to Termdodo

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Termdodo as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

- Follow standard Go code style and conventions
- Use `gofmt` to format your code
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Add comments for complex algorithms and business logic

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Add godoc comments to all exported functions
- Include examples in your documentation
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes
